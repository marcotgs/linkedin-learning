 - Benchmarking performance
 - Profiling code execution
 - Knowing what to optimize

# Description
 Node.js apps are known for their blazing-fast speed, but hard-to-find  - bugs and suboptimal processes can drag performance down. Isolating the  - problem in the stack can often grind productivity to a halt. In this course, Node.js developer Jon Peck shows how to debug and speed up your site as he walks through how to fix a complete—but flawed—rock-paper-scissors game. Jon shows how to log problems, debug issues, measure performance, implement caching, and continuously optimize your application for performance.

# Agenda

## Introduction

 - Documenting problems
 - When is a problem resolved?
## 2. Introducing Microservices

 - What's a microservice architecture?

 - Implementing Express error pages
 - Choosing a logging library
 - Adding Winston for Node logging
 - Request logging with Morgan
 - Correlating requests in logs
 - Cross-application request correlation
 - Challenge: Cross-application request IDs
 - Solution: Cross-application request IDs

## 4. Debugging Node.js Applications
